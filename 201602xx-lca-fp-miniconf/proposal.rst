Functional Programming Miniconf


Miniconf Summary
================

The Functional Programming (FP) Miniconf will provide the
opportunity for FP practitioners and people interested in FP to
learn the concepts, tools and techniques of FP in a supportive
environment, to be challenged in their thinking about programming
and the tools of the craft, and to be inspired to embrace the
advantages of FP in their workplaces and open source projects and
communities.

*Functional programming* is an approach to programming that models
computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.  Drawing
from fields of mathematics including lambda calculus and category
theory, FP emphasises *purity*, *immutability*, *abstraction* and
*composability* - qualities that underpin FP's reputation of
succinctness, comprehensibility and the ability to move fast and
*not* break things.


A little background
-------------------

In recent years, awareness and practice of functional programming has
surged with the emergence of new languages (e.g. Scala, Clojure,
Idris), the ongoing improvement of older functional programming
languages (e.g. OCaml, Haskell) and other languages adopting features
to better facilitate functional programming (e.g. Java 8, C# 3.0).
Organisations in Australia exploiting FP include REA Group,
Atlassian, Commonwealth Bank, Ambiata, NICTA and Anchor, and many other
companies are using or considering adopting FP.

Some popular open source functional programming languages
include:

- Haskell_: pure, lazy, statically typed
- Scala_: statically typed functional language for the JVM 
- Clojure_: JVM Lisp dialect with powerful concurrency primitives
- Erlang_: dynamically typed with focus on fault tolerance and 
  real-time applications
- `F#`_: statically typed FP for Common Language Infrastructure

Some well-known open source programs written in functional
programming languages include:

- xmonad_ (window manager; Haskell)
- git-annex_ (Git-based archiving tool; Haskell)
- CouchDB_ and Riak_ (databases; Erlang)
- Pandoc_ (universal document converter; Haskell)
- Lichess_ (Internet chess server; Scala)

Call for Proposals
------------------

Please email proposals to ``frase@frase.id.au``.  The standard talk
duration is 30 minutes *including time for questions*.

We are looking for talks that will interest FP newcomers and
experienced practitioners alike.  Accordingly, we are unlikely to
accept proposals that assume significant prior knowledge of FP,
category theory, etc.  As with the conference proper, all talks must
relate in some way to free/open source software.

In particular, we welcome proposals that:

- Teach FP concepts or techniques that are applicable in a variety
  of languages, including languages not normally considered
  "functional".

- Blow minds with emerging tools or techniques, and introduce the
  underlying theory.

- Clearly convey the benefits of FP for writing correct,
  maintainable and high performance software.

- Demonstrate awesome open source programs or libraries written in a
  functional programming language and expound important aspects of
  their implementation.

- Educate attendees on how to learn or teach FP effectively.


Organiser Biography
===================

Fraser Tweedale
---------------

Fraser is an identity management engineer at Red Hat where he works
on FreeIPA and Dogtag Certificate System.  He is interested in
security and cryptography and cares about making it easier for
humans to use properly.  By night Fraser writes programs in Haskell,
proves theorems in Coq and is gradually exploring dependent types,
category theory and other exciting intersections of mathematics and
computer science.

Katie McLaughlin
----------------

Katie is a Senior Cloud Development Engineer at Bulletproof, working
to automate all the things. She has experience developing
enterprise-grade solutions in a menagerie of programming languages
and environments, including Haskell. Since using Haskell, she is no
now longer able to take any other language's attempt at a "type
system" seriously.


Relevant Experience
===================

Fraser Tweedale
---------------

I am a co-organiser of Brisbane Functional Programming Group, a
large group which meets twice per month (talks night and hack night).
I have also presented at the group several times and am involved in
selecting talks and mentoring speakers.

Along with Katie Miller, I was co-organiser of the Functional
Programming BoF at linux.conf.au 2015.  Its success, along with the
observation of a greater number of FP-related talks at linux.conf.au
in recent years and the urging of some other delegates, inspired me
to propose the FP Miniconf for linux.conf.au 2016!

Katie McLaughlin
----------------

I am the co-organiser of Port443, and a member and volunteer of a
number of local programming groups in Sydney, including FPSyd,
Port80, and DevOpsSyd.  At linux.conf.au 2015, my former colleague
Andrew Cowie and I presented two separate talks related to
Vaultaire, a timeseries datastore written in Haskell. I will be
helping Fraser with this miniconf as 2IC, and we hope that running
this miniconf at linux.conf.au 2016 will help attendees learn more
about functional programming, and how its concepts can help improve
software in general.
