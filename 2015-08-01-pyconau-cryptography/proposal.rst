Talk Title
==========

Cooking with ``cryptography``


Abstract
========

The ``cryptography`` library emerged in 2014 with the goal of
becoming Python's "cryptographic standard library".  It is designed
to be easy to use but flexible, exposing a *recipes* layer for
common use cases, and a *hazmat* layer that provides crypto
primitives but demands users know what they're doing in order to use
them properly.

This talk will explain the motivations and goals of the
``cryptography`` library, take a tour of its features and discuss
its implementation.  ``cryptography`` will be compared to some other
popular and emerging crypto libraries.  Finally, we will examine
some real-world use of the library.

Audience members should have a passing familiarity with cryptography
(e.g. know the differences between hashing and encryption, or public
key and private key crypto) to get the most out of this talk.


Private Abstract
----------------

I am not involved in the development of ``cryptography`` - just a
user (some Red Hat projects are using the library).  If someone who
is directly involved in the project should submit an abstract, their
authority must be taken into account in the selection process.

Biography
=========

Fraser works at Red Hat on the FreeIPA identity management solution
and the Dogtag Certificate System.  He cares about security and
cryptography (and making it easy to use correctly!) and is deeply
interested in functional programming, type theory and theorem
proving.


Relevant Experience
===================

I have spoken regularly at user groups including BrisPy, Brisbane
Functional Programming Group and others.  Previous presentations at
conferences include:

- PyCon AU 2014 (descriptors)
- OSDC 2014 (FreeIPA; Haskell web development)
- linux.conf.au 2015 (FreeIPA; property-based testing)
- DevConf.cz 2015 (property-based testing)
- CrikeyCon 2015 (Let's Encrypt project)
