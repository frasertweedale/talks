# Smart cards and workstation login

*Smart cards* are cryptographic devices that can securely store keys
and certificates to enable a variety of authentication and
encryption applications.  Common use cases include:

- Physical access badges
- Workstation login (maybe you've seen this at a bank)
- Storing OpenPGP or SSH keys

Smart cards use a variety of physical interfaces including USB, NFC,
and the classic plastic card with contact pad.  TPMs and smartphone
*secure elements* can also be configured as smart cards.  The **PKCS
#11** standard provides a common interface to access smart card
crytpographic operations, including key generation and signing.  The
principle is that keys cannot be extracted from the hardware.

::: note

Software implementations are also possible, but offer none of the
physical security benefits.

:::

In this module you will configure a *software* smart card token and
walk through some real world scenarios:

- Generate a key on the token and sign a CSR
- Install the issued certifiate on the device
- Configure a FreeIPA domain for smart card authentication
- Authenticate to Kerberos using the smart card
- Configure a workstation for smart card based login
- Set up *GNOME Remote Desktop* to enable remote graphical login

::: note

Most activities in this module are to be performed on
`workstation.$DOMAIN`. SSH into this machine now.

**You will also need an RDP client to perform the graphical
workstation login.**  You can still do most of the activities
without it, but you will miss out on some of the payoff.

:::


## Setting up the smart card

The exact commands for initialising and configuring a smart card
differ by vendor.  In this workshop we are using the *SoftHSM*
software token implementation.  Because it is not a physical device,
SoftHSM is **not recommended for real world use**.  But it is
perfect for developing an understanding of the general procedure
required to use smart cards for X.509 applications.

The first step is to create a token.  This is the only
SoftHSM-specific operation.  Later steps will use the PKCS #11
interface to interact with the token.

```command {.workstation}
sudo softhsm2-util --init-token --slot 0 \
  --label "FakeSmartCard" \
  --pin 1234 \
  --so-pin 5678
```
```output
The token has been initialized and is reassigned to slot 2017281153
```

`--label` gives a human-friendly name for the token.  `--pin` and
`--so-pin` set the codes for user and administrator access to the
token.


### Generate key pair and CSR

Now generate a private key (in this case, a NIST P-256 ECC key):

```command {.workstation}
sudo p11-kit generate-keypair \
    pkcs11:token=FakeSmartCard --login \
    --type=ecdsa --curve=secp256r1 \
    --label ipa-key --id deadbeef
```

List objects and retrieve the PKCS #11 URI of the key:

```command {.workstation}
sudo p11-kit list-objects pkcs11:token=FakeSmartCard
```
```output
Object: #0
    uri: pkcs11:model=SoftHSM%20v2;manufacturer=SoftHSM%20project;serial=7c3fca5af83d4481;token=FakeSmartCard;id=%DE%AD%BE%EF;object=ipa-key;type=public
    class: public-key
    key-type: ec
    label: ipa-key
    id: de:ad:be:ef
    flags:
          local
          token
          modifiable
          copyable
          destroyable
```

The `uri` field in the output gives the PKCS #11 URI that refers to
the new key on this specific token.  Save its value; you will need
it in the next step.  **Make sure you surround the value in quotes
(`"..."`).**

```command {.workstation .no-copy}
PKCS11_URI="pkcs11:model=…;object=ipa-key;type=public"
```

Now create the CSR.  **OpenSSL will prompt for the user PIN** you
set when creating the token.

```command {.workstation}
sudo openssl req -new \
  -engine pkcs11 -keyform engine -key $PKCS11_URI \
  -config user_csr.cnf -out softhsm-user.csr
```
```output
Engine "pkcs11" set.
... some warnings (ignore them) ...
Enter PKCS#11 token PIN for FakeSmartCard:
```

::: note

***TODO TODO TODO update image to include `openssl-pkcs11` module.***

The OpenSSL PKCS #11 engine is provided by the `openssl-pkcs11` RPM
package on Fedora and RHEL.  Other distributions may name it
differently.

:::


### Request and import certificate

To request the certificate from the FreeIPA CA you need to
authenticate.  Authenticate as `admin`, because you'll need to use
that account soon.

```command {.workstation}
kinit admin
```

Now request the certificate from the CA.  Given the context, this
could also be called *enrolling* the smart card.

```command {.workstation}
ipa cert-request user.csr \
    --profile-id userCert \
    --principal user1 \
    --certificate-out softhsm-user.crt
```

Finally, import the certificate into the token:

```command {.workstation}
sudo p11-kit import-object pkcs11:token=FakeSmartCard \
  --file softhsm-user.crt \
  --label ipa-key --id deadbeef
```

## Enable smart card authentication for FreeIPA users

Smart card authentication requires setting a filter to control which
certificates are eligible to be matched against domain accounts.
**SSSD will always verify the certificate and ensure it chains up to
a trusted CA**.  But these match rules provide an additional filter
that can be used to further restrict certificate authentication.
This is often used to ensure that only particular issuers are used.

Let's just add a rule that accepts (valid) certificates from all
issuers:

```command {.workstation}
ipa certmaprule-add all-issuers \
    --matchrule '<ISSUER>.*'
```
```output
-----------------------------------------------------
Added Certificate Identity Mapping Rule "all-issuers"
-----------------------------------------------------
  Rule name: all-issuers
  Matching rule: <ISSUER>.*
  Enabled: True
```

In addition to the *match rule*, ***mapping rules*** are important
in some real world scenarios.  For example: when smart cards are
issued by a trusted third party, and you do not even see the
certificate until it is presented during login.  Or when certificate
lifetimes are so short that managing the `userCertificate`
attributes would be burdensome.

In such cases, the mapping rule lets you use information from the
certificate to match a user.  For example, the following rule
**maps** email address values in the *Subject Alternative Name*
extension to the user's `mail` attribute, but only when the
certificate issuer **matches** `O=Example Org`:

```command {.no-copy}
ipa certmaprule-add email-mapping-EXAMPLE-RULE \
    --matchrule="<ISSUER>O=Example Org" \
    --maprule="(mail={san_rfc822name})"
```


## Explicit Kerberos authentication with smart card

Now that the match rule has been created and the smart card is
ready, you can perform a Kerberos initial authentication.  Enter the
PIN when `kinit` prompts for it.

```command {.workstation}
sudo kinit user1 \
     -X X509_user_identity=PKCS11:libsofthsm2.so
```
```output
FakeSmartCard                    PIN:
```

Run `klist` to observe that the authentication succeeded:

```command {.workstation}
sudo klist
```
```output
Ticket cache: KCM:0
Default principal: user1@E1.PKI.FRASE.ID.AU

Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
01/18/2026 13:29:42  01/19/2026 12:35:00  krbtgt/E1.PKI.FRASE.ID.AU@E1.PKI.FRASE.ID.AU
```

The explicit `kinit` is useful to verify the smart card is working
and Kerberos PKINIT is set up correctly.


## Enable smart card workstation login

It is awkward for human users to authenticate using the `kinit`
command.  Obtaining the TGT during a smart card based workstation
login would be much nicer.  Let's set that up now!


### Make the token accessible to SSSD

::: note

We are about to make the SoftHSM token usable by all users on the
system.  This is needed because of how SSSD operates.  **Never** do
something like this in a real world setting!

Real hardware smart cards use the [OpenSC] system and
don't need these hacks.

[OpenSC]: https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki

:::

Change the ownership of all the data to `sssd` user and group:

```command {.workstation}
sudo chown -R sssd:sssd /var/lib/softhsm/tokens
```

Grant all users access to the token.  The directory and object names
are randomly generated UUIDs; the wildcards match them.

```command {.workstation}
sudo sh -c 'chmod 775 /var/lib/softhsm/tokens/*'
```

```command {.workstation}
sudo sh -c 'chmod 664 /var/lib/softhsm/tokens/*/*'
```


### Enable smart card login in SSSD and GDM

Use `authselect` to configure the PAM stack to enable smart card
login:

```command {.workstation}
sudo authselect enable-feature with-smartcard
```
```output
Make sure that SSSD service is configured and enabled.
See SSSD documentation for more information.

- with-smartcard is selected, make sure smartcard authentication
  is enabled in sssd.conf:
  - set "pam_cert_auth = True" in [pam] section
```

As the command output suggests, you must also edit
`/etc/sssd/sssd.conf` to enable SSSD to look up user certificates.
The `[pam]` section must look like:

```
[pam]
pam_cert_auth = True
```

SSSD also needs to know what CAs are trusted for user login.  By
default, SSSD looks at `/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem`.  Use a
symlink to point that location the FreeIPA CA trust store:

```command {.workstation}
sudo ln -s /etc/ipa/ca.crt \
    /etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem
```

Now restart SSSD:

```command {.workstation}
sudo systemctl restart sssd
```


## Enable graphical login via RDP

To simulate a workstation smart card login experience, we will
enable [*Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)*][wiki-rdp] login, using
***GNOME Remote Desktop***.

[wiki-rdp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol

RDP uses TLS to secure the traffic between client and server.  Using
Certmonger, request a service certificate for the RDP server to use:

```command {.client}
sudo ipa-getcert request \
    -f /etc/pki/tls/certs/rdp.crt \
    -k /etc/pki/tls/private/rdp.key \
    --key-owner gnome-remote-desktop \
    --cert-owner gnome-remote-desktop \
    -K host/$(hostname) \
    -D $(hostname)
```

The `--key-owner` and `--cert-owner` options tell Certmonger to
change the ownership of the files it creates, so the server process
can read them.  There are also options to change the mode (file
permissions), if you need that.

Now, tell GNOME Remote Desktop about the key and certificate:

```command {.workstation}
sudo grdctl --system rdp \
  set-tls-key  /etc/pki/tls/private/rdp.key
```

```command {.workstation}
sudo grdctl --system rdp \
  set-tls-cert /etc/pki/tls/certs/rdp.crt
```

::: note

You can ignore error messages that mention TPM credentials.

:::

Configure an RDP username and password.  These credentials are
unrelated to FreeIPA or system accounts.

```command {.workstation}
sudo grdctl --system rdp \
  set-credentials rdp hunter2
```

Allow RDP traffic through the firewall:

```command {.workstation}
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=rdp \
  && sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Finally, enable the RDP service:

```command {.workstation}
sudo grdctl --system rdp enable
```


## Bringing it all together

Use your RDP client to connect to
`workstation.e$N.pki.frase.id.au`.  You may need to prefix the
domain name with `rdp://`.  The TCP port is `3389`.

You may need to accept the server's certificate—which you issued and
configured!

Authenticate the RDP session with the RDP username and password
(`rdp`:`hunter2`).  If there is a *Domain* field, leave it blank.

The GDM login screen will greet you.  It will prompt you for the
smart card pin.  Enter the PIN and log in.  Then open the *Terminal*
app and run `klist`.  You will see that the user obtained a Kerberos
TGT during login.

All done!  You can log out and close your RDP client.
