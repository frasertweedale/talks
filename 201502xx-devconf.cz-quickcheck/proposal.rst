Abstract
========

An introduction to property-based testing, explaining its purpose
and benefits, and demonstrating its use.

Testing accounts for a large portion of the cost of software
development.  Tools to automate testing allow for more thorough
testing in less time.  Property-based testing provides ways to
define expected properties of functions under test and mechanisms to
automatically check whether those properties hold in a large number
of cases - or whether a property can be falsified.

Concepts will be demonstrated primarily in Haskell, using the
QuickCheck library.  Property-based testing is available in most
languages, so options for Python and Java will also be examined.
The talk will conclude with a discussion of the limitations of
property-based testing, and alternative approaches.
