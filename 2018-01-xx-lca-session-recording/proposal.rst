User Session Recording for the Enterprise
=========================================

Abstract
--------

For Open Source software to conquer the enterprise, we need to play
along with government and industry regulations, and help
organisations meet their audit requirements.  A flexible and
scalable user session recording solution is needed.

In this presentation we will discuss the limitations of existing
Open Source approaches, then present the *Scribery* project, an
end-to-end session recording solution with features including:

- terminal session playback and real-time monitoring (including what
  the user sees)

- correlation with audit log events

- Cockpit integration

- centralised and secure storage

- centralised control of what or whom to record, via SSSD and
  FreeIPA

The presentation will include demos of a user session being
recorded, stored centrally, inspected and played back, and of the
centralised control capability.

We will look at the architecture, discuss implementation challenges,
and conclude with an overview of the road ahead.

The intended audience is system administrators and security officers
responsible for security and compliance, and developers of security,
identity and policy management systems.

The *Scribery* project is being developed by the Red Hat Engineering
(Platform Security) team.  I work in that team on FreeIPA, which is
used for centralised control of session recording.
