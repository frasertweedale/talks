Identity 2.0: social and federated login
========================================

(40-minute session)

Whether you're developing public-facing web apps or deploying behind
the corporate firewall, the days of identity silos are over.  Social
and federated authentication are the new normal.  The advantages are
clear: developers and operators have less security-sensitive code to
write and deploy, and users enjoy less password fatigue and improved
productivity through single sign-on.

The wins are clear, but like most things in technology there is a
trade-off.  Federated authentication protocols are inherently more
elaborate than plain old passwords; more moving parts means more
complex deployment and more points of failure.

In this session for web developers and administrators, attendees
will learn and experience how to deploy and use federated auth,
end-to-end from the identity provider to the app.  The session will
cover:

- The basics of federated authentication including protocol
  overviews and comparisons.

- How to use social login providers for public-facing
  applications, allowing users to log in with an account they
  already have.

- How to leverage accounts in centralised identity management
  systems (FreeIPA, Active Directory, LDAP, etc) for single
  sign-on in an organisation.

- How identity brokers like Keycloak make it easy to use a
  variety of external authentication providers, and provide a
  consistent user experience across multiple applications.

- Security characteristics, and discussion of some challenging
  scenarios including testing, account merging and single sign-out.

The presentation will include a demo of a sample application being
configured to use social login, using Keycloak as an identity
broker.
