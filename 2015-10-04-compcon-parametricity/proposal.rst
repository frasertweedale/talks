Parametricity and other principles for professional programmers


Presentation Type

Talk.  Preferred length: 30 minutes.


Abstract
--------

Programmers must make all kinds of trade-offs in designing and
implementing software.  These can be due to business realities
(including deadlines) or technical requirements.  Unfortunately, due
to misinformation and unprincipled practices (in the past or
present), programmers sometimes engage in *false economies* - giving
up things of value without getting anything in return - instead of
legitimate trade-offs.

This is a talk about some of these false economies, and some
principles to apply to if your goal is to efficiently write and
maintain working software.  Some principles that will be covered
include:

- *fast and loose reasoning*, which leads to programs that are
  easier to reason about, compose and reuse;

- appropriate use of types in modelling a problem domain, which
  leads to fewer errors by making invalid values or state
  inadmissible;

- *parametricity*, being the ability to derive useful theorems from
  generic types;

- the importance of using tools that facilitate the fruitful
  application of these concepts.
