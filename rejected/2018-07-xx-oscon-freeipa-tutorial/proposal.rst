FreeIPA is an integrated identity management solution providing
centralized user, host and service management, authentication and

ease of deployment and management.  It is built on top of well-known
Open Source technologies and standards including 389 Directory
Server, MIT Kerberos and Dogtag Certificate System.

* Install a FreeIPA server and replica
* Enroll client machines in the domain
* Create and administer users
* Manage host-based access control (HBAC) policies
* Issue X.509 certificates for network services
* Configure a web server to use FreeIPA for user authentication and
  access control

There will some optional units which participants can
choose, based on their progress and use cases:

* Sudo rules
