Parser combinators: live coding a JSON parser from scratch
==========================================================

Parser combinators are like LEGO. You start with simple little
parsers and put them together to build something great. This
promotes code reuse, maintenance and testing. In this presentation
I'll live-code a parsing library and JSON parser from scratch!

I'll use Haskell, a concise functional programming language. The
audience will see the power and beauty of parser combinators
and understand some foundational programming abstraction.


Notes
-----

I've done variations of this talk before. I will rehearse it.
Failure modes are few. All I need is a machine with GHC and Vim.
Mistakes occur but Haskell helps me avoid them or quickly
find and fix them.

This proposal is more concrete; JSON is a well known use case.
