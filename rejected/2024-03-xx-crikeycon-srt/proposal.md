# Vulnerability triage and security response for Open Source ecosystems

## Abstract

Open Source programming languages, libraries, frameworks and tools
are often the first links in the software supply chain.  This
presentation will cover the "why" and "how" of vulnerability triage
and security response for Open Source projects and ecosystems.
Speaking from my experience bootstrapping and leading the Haskell
Security Response Team, I will discuss a range of topics including:

- Why it is important for Open Source ecosystems to have a security
  response/triage process.

- What team size, skills and scope of work are needed.

- Standards and services for defining and disseminating security
  advisories for open source software, including OSV and VEX.

- Where to find security advisories for the open source tools or
  libraries you use.

- Considerations for communication and coordination with
  "downstream" users and distributors.

- How security advisories can strengthen development practices and
  tooling *within* your ecosystem.

## Why is your presentation different/innovative/significant/edgy?

I haven't seen this topic covered much in the wider infosec scene.
I want to share what I learned while leading the Haskell SRT, so
that the audience knows how to consume AND produce security
advisories for open source components.
