Talk Title
==========

Identity 2.0: the what, why and how of social and federated login


Length
======

40-minute session


Elevator pitch
==============

Are you sick of managing so many online accounts? Password fatigue
got you down? If you're a service provider, how can you avoid
contributing to the problem?

Federated/social login is the solution. In this talk you will learn
what it is, how it works, and why you should care. There will be
demos.


Abstract
========

Whether you're developing public-facing web apps or deploying behind
the corporate firewall, the days of identity silos are over.  Social
auth (*log in with FooBookHub*) and federated identity (*SAML*,
*OpenID Connect* and friends) are the new normal.  The advantages
are clear: developers and operators have less security-sensitive
code to write and deploy, and users experience less password/account
fatigue, and improved productivity through *single sign-on*.

The wins are clear, but like most things in technology there is a
trade-off.  Federated authentication protocols have more moving
parts than plain old passwords.  More moving parts means more
complex deployment and more points of failure.

In this session for web developers and administrators/operations
folks, attendees will learn how to use federated auth, end-to-end
from the identity provider to the app.  The session will cover:

- The basics of federated authentication including **protocol**
  overviews and comparisons.

- How to use **social auth** providers for public-facing
  applications, allowing users to log in with an account they
  already have.

- How to leverage accounts in centralised identity management
  systems (*FreeIPA*, *Active Directory*, *LDAP*, etc) for **single
  sign-on** in an organisation.

- How **identity brokers** like *Keycloak* make it easy to use a
  variety of external authentication providers, and provide a
  consistent user experience across multiple applications.

- How to use external identities in your applications with the help
  of your web server or web framework.

- **Security** characteristics, and discussion of some challenging
  scenarios including testing, account merging and single sign-out.

and the Dogtag Certificate System.  He's interested in security,
cryptography, functional programming, type theory and theorem
proving.  Crazy about jalape√±os.
