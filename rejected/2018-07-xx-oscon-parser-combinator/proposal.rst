Write you some parser combinators for great parsing!
====================================================

Description
-----------

(max 400 chars)

Parser combinators are an elegant approach to parsing that enable
readable, maintainable parsers and promote code reuse.  In this
live coding session we'll see how they work by building a JSON
parser from scratch, in Haskell.  Attendees will learn how to use
parser combinators and understand their usefulness, and enhance
their intuition for some foundational functional abstractions.

Abstract
--------

(3..6 para)

Parser combinators are functions that construct complex parsers out
of smaller, simpler parsers.  Like LEGO, the building blocks are
generic and can be combined in different ways to create parsers for
different formats.  This elegant approach results in readable,
maintainable parsers, and promotes code reuse.

Writing a parser combinator library is almost a rite of passage for
functional programmers.  In addition to solving a real-world
problem, the programmer builds their intuition of fundamental
abstractions including functors and applicative functors.

In this session we will build a JSON (simplified subset) parser from
scratch, using Haskell.  After discussing the target format and what
we want the parser to look like, we'll dive down to to the basic
definition of a functional parser, and implement the simplest
possible parser.  From there we will define the required combinators
and complete the JSON parser.

The session will conclude with a brief discussion of considerations
for implementing or choosing a parser combinator library for
industrial use.


Who is the presentation for?
----------------------------

Software developers, functional programmers


Audience level
--------------

Intermediate


What's the takeaway for the audience?
-------------------------------------

The audience will grasp the usefulness of parser combinators for
many kinds of parsing, and learn how to use them to build parsers
for arbitrary formats.  Additionally, intuition for some
foundational functional abstractions will be acquired or enhanced.


Prerequisite knowledge
----------------------

Understanding of basic data types such as strings, maps/dicts and
lists is essential.  Functional programming experience may help but
is not essential.
