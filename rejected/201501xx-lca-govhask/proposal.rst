Talk Title
==========

GovHask - Haskell, open data and rapid app development.


Abstract
========

Learn what happened when three functional programming aficionadi took
on the GovHack open data competition armed with little more than a
Haskell compiler, some Hackage packages and whole lot of hubris.

GovHack is an annual open data event in Australia.  A coordinated
release of federal, state and local government data is celebrated
with a weekend-long hackfest, with prizes awarded for the most
interesting and useful apps, mashups or remixes.

Three hackers (including the presenter) who are passionate about
Haskell - a strongly typed, purely functional programming language -
entered GovHack 2014 to see what they could build in a weekend using
Haskell.  `Brisbane Park Finder`_ - a site for searching for parks
in Brisbane based on location and facilities - was born.

This presentation will:

- Introduce the team and explain why we are passionate about
  Haskell, types and functional programming.

- Briefly demonstrate Brisbane Park Finder and provide some
  high-level implementation details including import of the
  datasets, and request processing and markup generation via the
  Snap_ web framework.  Particularly useful features of Snap and
  some other libraries will be discussed.  No prior Haskell or
  functional programming knowledge required.

- Discuss how we benefited from using Haskell and strong types
  during the competition, and identify the pain points and places
  where type safety was not accomplished, along with the reasons
  why.

- Platform support and options for deploying Haskell applications
  will be outlined in brief.

- Encourage people to try Haskell and to support open data
  initiatives.

This presentation will not:

- Attempt to explain monads.

Speaker Bio
===========

Fraser is a developer at Red Hat, where he works on the FreeIPA
identity management solution and Dogtag Certificate System.  He is
passionate about security and privacy.  In his spare time, Fraser
writes a lot of Haskell and patiently awaits the strongly-typed
functional programming revolution.


Relevant experience
===================

Having presented at various Brisbane user groups over the past few
years (Brisbane Functional Programming Group, BrisPy, Brisbane Perl
Mongers, Brisbane Free Software), I have levelled up and begun
submitting talk proposals for conferences.  In August I was a
speaker at PyCon Australia.
