The Power of Property-based Testing
===================================

Ever missed a corner case in your tests? Yeah, me too. If only we
could get the computer to find them...

Great news! Property-based testing addresses this problem, and it is
available in almost every language. This talk will introduce the
technique and explain the advantages and limitations. There will be
live demos in several languages. We will end with a discussion of
related (even more powerful) tools and techniques.

Similar to previous talks I've done, such as my DevConf.cz 2015

demos I will do
