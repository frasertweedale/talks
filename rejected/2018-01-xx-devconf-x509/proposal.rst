X.509: Beyond TLS
=================

Abstract
--------

Most developers and admins know about X.509 as the certificate
format used in TLS. But do you about the other X.509 use cases?
This talk will cover some less well known ways X.509 is used in
practice.

We will begin with a review of public key cryptography fundamentals.
Then we will examine the anatomy of X.509 certificates and chains of
trust, and discuss how certificates are used in TLS.

Next we will investigate (and live demo!) some non-TLS use cases
including S/MIME for email, Smart Card-based system login and
Kerberos PKINIT.  We'll discuss how the certificate management
features of FreeIPA (an Open Source identity management system)
address these use cases.

The talk will conclude with a discussion of recent developments in
certificate security.

ways X.509 is used in practice.
