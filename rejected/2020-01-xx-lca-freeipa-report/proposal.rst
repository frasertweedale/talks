The FreeIPA report: 2015-2019


Abstract
========

Organisations need identity management to secure their systems.
Authentication and authorisation are critical concerns, but identity
management need not be a burden for administrators or users.

FreeIPA is an identity management solution providing centralised
user, host and service management, authentication and authorisation
in Linux/UNIX networked environments, with a focus on ease of
deployment and management.  It is built on top of well-known Open
Source programs including 389 Directory Server, MIT Kerberos and
Dogtag Certificate System.

It is five years since the last comprehensive overview of FreeIPA at
linux.conf.au.  A lot has happened in that time.  This presentation
will give the audience a broad overview of enterprise identity
management and how FreeIPA fits into the picture.  Then I will
outline the major improvements in FreeIPA and related projects from
the last few years.  Not only product enhancements, but also the
project, team and community.  Finally we will look ahead at what's
on the roadmap.
