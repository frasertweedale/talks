Functional Programming Devroom
==============================

Description
-----------

Functional programming (FP) is an approach to programming that
models computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
Drawing from fields of mathematics including lambda calculus and
category theory, FP emphasises purity, immutability, abstraction and
composability - qualities that underpin FP's reputation of
succinctness, comprehensibility and the ability to move fast and
*not* break things.  Popular FP languages include Haskell, Scala,
Clojure, Erlang, Elm, Purescript and Rust; well known projects using
FP include xmonad, git-annex, Pandoc, CouchDB and Riak.

The FP Devroom will provide the opportunity for FP practitioners and
people interested in FP to learn the concepts, tools and techniques
of FP in a supportive environment, to be challenged in their
thinking about programming and the tools of the industry, and to be
inspired to embrace the benefits of FP in their workplaces and open
source communities.

We are seeking presentations that will be of interest to free
software developers who are interesting learning about FP and how to
apply it in their projects.  Prior experience with FP should not be
assumed.  Possible topics areas include:

- Teaching foundational FP concepts and techniques

- Project case studies: architecture or API design of a free
  software project that uses FP

- How to integrate functional languages into non-FP projects

- Practicalities of releasing, deploying, monitoring and maintaining
  programs written in functional languages

- Experience reports about adopting FP in a project or organisation

- Quantitative or qualitative research about the use of FP in the
  free software community

- How to contribute to open source FP projects

- Teaching/advocating FP, running user groups, etc.


Why does it fit FOSDEM?
-----------------------

As free software expands in reach and complexity, so does the need
for an approach and toolset that helps us write programs that are
correct, maintainable, reusable, readable and composable.
Functional programming is the best way to achieve these goals.
Therefore it is important to educate free software developers about
FP, its benefits and how they can use it in their projects.


Submitter's affinity to the topic
---------------------------------

I am one of the organisers of the Brisbane Functional Programming
Group, a large FP user group in Brisbane, Australia.  I am also the
author/maintainer/contributor of several free programs and libraries
written in Haskell.

I believe FP is an essential tool for the free software movement
(and the software industry in general).  So I advocate FP, teach
everyone I can, organise devrooms, etc :)
