Data format ergonomics: design and implementation
=================================================

When data formats are ambiguous or insecure, implementers and users
suffer. Using JOSE and other case studies, I'll discuss mistakes to
avoid when designing data formats, and demonstrate programming
techniques to mitigate some issues. We'll also discuss
considerations when choosing a wire format (JSON, CBOR, ASN.1, etc),
and interoperability matters.  Each topic will yield simple,
actionable take-aways for the audience.


Notes
-----

This will be similar to my Pass the SALT 2018 presentation (link
below), with less focus on security and more case studies besides
JOSE.
