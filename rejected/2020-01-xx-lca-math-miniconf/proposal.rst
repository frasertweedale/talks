The Mathematics of Computing


Miniconf Summary
================

Mathematics lies at the heart of computing.  We (mostly) compute to
solve real world, concrete problems.  But in doing so, we must use
the tools of mathematics, and the results of applied mathematics.
This miniconf is all about the branches of mathematics that equip us
to do what we do, and empower us to do it better.

Topics in scope include (but are not limited to):

- History of computation and computability theory

- Theoretical foundations of programming languages or language
  features

- Functional programming; foundational abstractions for programming
  (and their implementation, in any language)

- Case studies in software or hardware problem solving using
  mathematics

- Formal methods and theorem proving

- Analysis of algorithms; computational complexity; exposition or
  comparison of noteworthy algorithms

- Mathematical aspects of cryptography and security

- Numerical, statistical or analytical methods of problem solving
  (general discussion or specific programs/libraries)

- How mathematics underpins or is applied in certain problem
  domains, e.g. networks, AI/ML, computer vision, databases,
  distributed systems

- Mathematics of digital electronics, circuit and hardware design;
  quantum computing

Talks will be at an *introductory* level.  Talks may assume a
high-school level of mathematics and, if programming-related, some
programming experience.  Talks will inspire, equip and enlighten
attendees.  The Mathematics of Computing Miniconf is not an ivory
tower.  We welcome everyone in a spirit of shared discovery,
lifelong learning and continuous improvement.


Private abstract
================

I was the organiser of the linux.conf.au 2016 Functional Programming
(FP) Miniconf, and 2018 Applied FP miniconf, which were both
successful.  With this proposal I want to expand the scope to
include other branches of mathematics that contribute to our
industry, and the success of practitioners in it.

The success of the free software movement depends on many things,
including the quality (correctness, robustness, maintainability,
readability, usability) of the software we produce.  The tools of
mathematics exist to help us deliver on this.  So it is important to
learn about these tools, and teach others what we have learned.  The
Mathematics of Computing Miniconf serves this goal.
