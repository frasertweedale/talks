Producing personalised packages with Poudriere
==============================================

FreeBSD binary packages have made life easier for everyday FreeBSD
users.  Compiling everything from source is a thing of the past.
Almost all the software from ports is available in the official
binary package repositories.  Alas, for many packages, one size does
not fit all.  Poudriere is the solution for when the default package
configuration does not meet your needs.

Poudriere reads ports trees and configurations, and builds binary
package repositories.  The official package repositories are build
using Poudriere, but you can use it to build customised packages
too.  In this presentation I will explain FreeBSD binary package
repository configuration, and demonstrate how to use Poudriere to
build customised packages.
