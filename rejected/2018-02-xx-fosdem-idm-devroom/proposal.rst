Identity and Access Management Devroom
======================================

Identity and Access Management (IAM/IdM) is a concept that touches
everyone's lives.  We all have many identities and associated
credentials to manage.  At work, we need to access many kinds of
services every day.  Free software projects, like any kind of
organisation, need to define and enforce policies about who can
access what.  Security is paramount but efficiency matters too!

The IAM Devroom is devoted to all things Identity Management.
Presentation topics could include:

- Security: algorithms and protocols for IAM, passwords and password
  alternatives

- Federated and social identity; leveraging external identities in
  applications

- Audit, compliance, monitoring

- User experience, desktop integration

- Free software IAM offerings; migrating from or integrating with
  proprietary solutions


Why does it fit FOSDEM?
-----------------------

All computer users need to manage and secure their identities and
systems.  Moreover, free software projects (especially larger ones)
have sophisticated identity management needs.  This devroom will
present essential information about this topic to the people who
need to know about it.

Finally, to conquer the enterprise the free software movement needs
world class identity management offerings.  The IAM devroom will get
attendees excited about what is happening in this space!
