**Public Key Infrastructure: common and emerging use cases**


Abstract
========

SSL/TLS has been securing Internet traffic for two decades and the
X.509 public key infrastructure (PKI) on which it is based has been
with us even longer.  Over the years the protocols and certificate
formats have evolved incrementally, but emerging use cases are
driving significant change in Dogtag Certificate System, an
open-source PKI implementation.

This talk will introduce fundamental PKI concepts including public
key cryptography, certificate authorities, certificate chains and
revocation.  We will discuss today's common PKI use cases, how these
concepts are applied to solve them, and the current architecture of
the Dogtag Certificate System in relation to these.

An examination of recent developments in traditional PKI use cases
and emerging use cases from other domains including identity
management and cloud infrastructure highlight the need to teach the
old Dogtag some new tricks.  The talk will conclude with an overview
of upcoming and possible future changes in Dogtag to meet the PKI
needs of tomorrow.
