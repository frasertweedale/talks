Why service discovery?
======================

- There are now multiple public (and private) ACME services

- Different servers will support different identifier types and
  validation methods

- Clients need to know: *what server(s) can I use?*

- Explicit client configuration can be challenging

- Goal: automatic selection of "best" server in the environment,
  without explicit configuration


Service discovery protocols
===========================

- Central registry vs distributed/P2P (e.g. DNS-SD/mDNS)

- In enterprise environments, DNS SRV records [`RFC2782`_] are used
  for LDAP, Kerberos and mail servers [`RFC6186`_]

- DNS-SD [`RFC6763`_] = SRV + supplementary data (TXT) + listing (PTR)

.. _RFC2782: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2782
.. _RFC6186: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6186
.. _RFC6763: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763


Assumptions
===========

- ACME client has network configuration (e.g. via DHCP)...

  - including a domain name (or something similar)

- Organisation can manage its DNS records

- Successful retrieval of directory object â†’ server is
  available


ACME Service Discovery (1)
==========================

- Based on DNS-SD

- Client determines "parent domain(s)"

  - DNS search domain(s), Kerberos realm(s), etc

  - or explicit configuration


ACME Service Discovery (2)
==========================

- Client constructs name ``_acme-server._tcp.$PARENT``

- *Service Instance Names* listed in the PTR records::

    $ORIGIN corp.example.

    _acme-server._tcp PTR CorpCA._acme-server._tcp
    _acme-server._tcp PTR C4A._acme-server._tcp


ACME Service Discovery (3)
==========================

- Each *Service Instance Name* owns SRV and TXT records that
  describe the service::

    $ORIGIN corp.example.

    CorpCA._acme-server._tcp SRV 10 0 443 ca
    CorpCA._acme-server._tcp TXT "path=/acme" "i=email,dns"

    C4A._acme-server._tcp    SRV 20 0 443 certs4all.example.
    C4A._acme-server._tcp    TXT "path=/acme/v2" "i=dns"


ACME Service Discovery (4)
==========================

- Client chooses "best" server, e.g.::

    CorpCA._acme-server._tcp SRV 10 0 443 ca
    CorpCA._acme-server._tcp TXT "path=/acme" "i=email,dns"

- Construct URL ``<https://ca.corp.example/acme>``; GET directory

- Any problem, try the next server / parent domain


Working code
============

- Certbot plugin:
  https://github.com/frasertweedale/certbot/tree/feature/discovery

- Blog post:
  https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-redhat/posts/2020-11-13-acme-service-discovery.html


Needs discussion
================

- Scope of SRV priority and weight

- Exclude names in ``.local``?

- DNS security: mention DoT and DoH?

- Parent domain selection; better / more secure examples


Next steps
==========

- Give feedback

  - Issues / PRs to https://github.com/frasertweedale/i-d

- WG adoption?


Other work
==========

- Express server capabilities in directory "meta" fields

  - `draft-tweedale-acme-server-capabilities-00 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tweedale-acme-server-capabilities-00>`_

- Is anyone interested in SRVName support?
