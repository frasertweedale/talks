Data format ergonomics: design and implementation
=================================================

When data formats are ambiguous or insecure, implementers and users
suffer. Through case studies including JOSE/JWT, I'll discuss
mistakes to avoid when designing and implementing data formats, and
demonstrate programming techniques to mitigate some issues. I'll
give tips for choosing an interchange format (JSON, CBOR, ASN.1,
etc), and how to promote interop. Each topic will yield simple,
memorable, actionable take-aways for the audience.


Notes
-----

This will be similar to my Pass the SALT 2018 presentation (link
below), with less focus on security and more case studies besides
JOSE/JWT.
