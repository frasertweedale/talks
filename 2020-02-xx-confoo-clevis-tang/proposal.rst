Clevis and Tang: securing your secrets at rest
==============================================

Full disk encryption is security doctrine but to avoid downtime,
repetition and mistakes we need to automate it, securely! Key escrow
is one approach but we can do better.

McCallum-Relyea is a key agreement protocol based on Diffie-Hellman.
Along with Shamir's Secret Sharing we can implement secure, robust
key decryption systems. I will explain these algorithms and
demonstrate the Tang and Clevis implementations that you can use
today.

Notes
-----

Tang and Clevis are open source projects, available in most Linux
distributions. This will be similar to my AusCERT talk
(https://youtu.be/Z0NwVHoW3F8) but hopefully without the demo
failures!
