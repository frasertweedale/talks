Introduction to Property-Based Testing
======================================

Ever missed a corner case in your tests? Yeah, me too. If only we
could get the computer to find themâ€¦

Great news! Property-based testing addresses this problem, and it is
available for almost every language. I will introduce the technique
and explain its advantages and limitations. There will be live demos
in various languages. I'll also review some related techniques
including exhaustive checking, fuzzing and theorem proving.

Similar to previous talks I've done, such as my DevConf.cz 2015

See also my OSDC 2014 lightning talk, which is an example of the
kind of live demos I will do:
