# Security response for open source ecosystems

## Abstract

Open Source programming languages, libraries and frameworks sit at
the base of the software supply chain.  That's why it's critical for
open source projects and ecosystems to establish security response
teams and infrastructure.  I'll share my experiences and lessons
learned from bootstrapping and leading the Haskell security response
team.  Attendees will learn how to build or support an effective and
sustainable security apparatus for the projects you participate in,
or rely on.

Particular topics I will cover include:

- Why it is important for Open Source ecosystems to have a security
  response/triage process.

- What team size, skills and scope of work are needed.

- Standards and services for advisory information and responsible
  disclosure, including OSV, VEX and VINCE.

- Where to find security advisories for the open source tools or
  libraries you use.

- Considerations for communication and coordination with
  redistributors and users.

- How publishing security advisories can strengthen development
  practices and tooling *within* your ecosystem.

- Why funding open source security work is important, and ideas for
  seeking it.

This is a (mostly) non-technical presentation. The intended audience
is anyone who contributes to or builds using Open Source languages
or tools, and businesses who rely on Open Source (so, all of them?)
