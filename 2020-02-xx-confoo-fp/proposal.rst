Why Functional Programming?
===========================

Is functional programming (FP) an essential programming tool, or
abstract nonsense? It depends who you ask. This presentation for
programmers of all backgrounds and experience will strive to
convince you of the former.

We will look at benefits of type systems and what kinds of
abstraction are possible. I'll show how FP helps you develop working
programs faster and results in code that is more readable and
maintainable and easier to test.

-----------------

I have spoken at many confs about functional programming, both
introductory talks at general programming conferences, and in-depth
talks at FP conferences.  (See links in my bio).

This introductory talk will use Haskell to demonstrate basic
concepts and advantages of FP. I will draw on personal experience,
case studies and empirical results.
