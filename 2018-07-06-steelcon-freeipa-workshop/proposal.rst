FreeIPA: Open Source Identity Management


Abstract
========

In this workshop, participants will learn about FreeIPA and get
hands-on experience installing and managing FreeIPA servers,
clients, users and policies.

FreeIPA is an integrated identity management solution providing
centralised user, host and service management, authentication and
authorisation in Linux/UNIX networked environments, with a focus on
ease of deployment and management.  It is built on top of well-known
Open Source technologies and standards including 389 Directory
Server, MIT Kerberos and Dogtag Certificate System.

Organisations use FreeIPA to provide centralised management of
identities and security policies.  By avoiding identity silos,
security goals can be achieved with reduced effort and improved
auditability.

This session will begin with a short presentation providing an
overview of FreeIPA's capabilities and architecture, and the
Kerberos authentication protocol.  The rest of the session is
devoted to the practical workshop curriculum.  Participants will:

- Install a FreeIPA server and replica and enrol a client machine
- Create and administer users
- Manage host-based access control (HBAC) policies
- Issue TLS certificates for network services
- Configure a web server to use FreeIPA for user authentication and
  access control

There are some elective units participants can choose from, based on
their progress and interests:

- OTP two-factor authentication
- Advanced certificate management: profiles, sub-CAs and user certificates
- OpenSSH key management
- Sudo rule administration
- SELinux user maps
- ...and more!
