Security and Privacy Miniconf
=============================

  Our digital world is in peril.  Schneier, the spirit of security,
  can no longer stand the terrible destruction plaguing our
  Internet.  He sends five magic IoT Things** to five special
  whitehats...

If only we really could summon Captain Security to defeat all the
baddies, fix the broken protocols, clean up our insecure technology
and save the day!  In reality, it is up to all of us, and the
Security Miniconf is here to help.

The linux.conf.au 2017 Security Miniconf will feature a series of
talks explaining and demonstrating important security and privacy
concepts, techniques and initiatives.  Whether you are a developer,
sysadmin, UX designer or anthropologist, there will be something at
the Security Miniconf to help you or your users live a more secure
digital life.


Call for Proposals
------------------

The standard talk duration is 30 minutes *including time for
questions*.  Please email proposals to ``frase@frase.id.au``, along
with a brief personal biography.

We are looking for talks that demonstrate and explain important
security concepts, tools or practices for end users of technology
and for developers, engineers, designers, project managers and
operations staff building and delivering the technology (software or
hardware).

Possible topic areas include, but are not limited to:

- Introductions to popular or emerging open source security tools
- How UX/UI design can influence application security
- Security features in open source operating systems or programs,
  and how to use them
- Authentication and authorisation technologies and standards
- Secure software development techniques/practices
- Offensive techniques (including social engineering)
- Security incident detection and response
- Web or Cloud security

Presentations with live demos or interactive aspects are encouraged.
Please include details of such in your proposal, *especially* if
the conference network will be used.


Private abstract
----------------

As a developer in Red Hat's Platform Security department (working on
identity management and X.509 PKI), and with a keen personal
interest in security and privacy, I am keen to see security Front
and Centre at linux.conf.au 2017!

Whilst propellor-twirling deep dives into particular security
technologies are in scope for the miniconf, I hope to build a well
rounded program that also promotes security tools and practices to
everyday users of open source programs and the people building them,
and looks at human factors to help people better understand the
challenges and threats.


Special requirements
--------------------

Proposals that involve demonstration of security-related techniques
on conference network will be carefully vetted to ensure that
nothing potentially harmful or of dubious legality will take place.
Speakers with such ambitions will be encouraged to demonstrate the
techniques using virtual machines on their own computers, if
possible.

Any uncertainties will be disclosed and discussed with conference
organisers and network team prior to acceptance of proposals.
