Open Source Security and Privacy Miniconf
=========================================

  Our digital world is in peril.  Schneier, the spirit of security,
  can no longer stand the terrible destruction plaguing our
  Internet.  He sends five magic IoT Things to five special
  whitehats...

If only we really could summon Captain Security to defeat all the
baddies, fix the broken protocols, clean up our insecure technology
and save the day!  In reality, it is up to all of us.  The need for
security in all levels of the software (and hardware) lifecycle and
for *usable* privacy and anonymity tools in an age of surveillance
is abundantly clear.  How can we achieve these goals?  The Security
and Privacy Miniconf is here to help!

The linux.conf.au 2017 Security and Privacy Miniconf will bring
together users, researchers and practitioners involved in, or simply
interested in, security topics in Open Source software and hardware.
The program will feature a series of talks explaining and
demonstrating important security and privacy concepts, techniques
and initiatives.  Whether you are a researcher, developer, sysadmin,
UX designer or anthropologist, there will be something at the
Security Miniconf to help you or your users live a more secure
digital life.


Call for Proposals
------------------

The standard talk duration is 30 minutes *including time for
questions*.  Please email proposals to ``frase@frase.id.au``, along
with a brief personal biography.

We are looking for talks that demonstrate and explain important
security concepts, tools or practices for end users of technology
and for developers, engineers, designers, project managers and
operations staff building and delivering the technology (software or
hardware).

Possible topic areas include, but are not limited to:

- Introductions to popular or emerging open source security tools
- How UX/UI design can influence application security
- Security features in open source operating systems or programs,
  and how to use them
- Authentication and authorisation technologies
- Secure software development techniques/practices
- Offensive techniques (including social engineering)
- Security incident detection, forensics and response
- Web, Cloud or IoT security
- Hardware and physical security

Presentations with live demos or interactive aspects are encouraged.
Please include details of such in your proposal, *especially* if
the conference network will be used.


Private abstract
----------------

Last year's conference lacked a dedicated security miniconf.
Obviously, there are plenty of conferences dedicated to security,
but I think there is enough interest among linux.conf.au attendees
(based on the attendance at the security-related talks we've seen in
the past) to support a full day miniconf program.

Whilst deep dives into particular security technologies are in scope
for the miniconf, we hope to build a well rounded program that also
promotes security tools and practices to everyday users of open
source programs and the people building them, and looks at human
factors to help people better understand the challenges and threats.


Special requirements
--------------------

Proposals that involve demonstration of security-related techniques
on conference network will be carefully vetted to ensure that
nothing potentially harmful or of dubious legality will take place.
Speakers with such ambitions will be encouraged to demonstrate the
techniques using virtual machines on their own computers, if
possible.

Any uncertainties will be disclosed and discussed with conference
organisers and network team prior to acceptance of proposals.
