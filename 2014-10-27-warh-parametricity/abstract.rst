Parametricity, or Theorems for Free
-----------------------------------

Say more by saying less.  Learn how parametric types, when used with
a sufficiently strong type system, help the programmer comprehend
code by invalidating candidate programs.  Parametricity helps the
programmer by enabling deduction of theories about what a program
cannot do, sometimes to the point of leaving no ambiguity.
