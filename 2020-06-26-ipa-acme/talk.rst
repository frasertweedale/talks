1: ACME overview
==================

- *Automated Certificate Management Environment*

- Automated *identifer validation*, issuance and renewal

- Automation enables:
  - shorter lifetimes (better security)
  - easier/automatic deployment (â†’ TLS everywhere)
  - cost savings (less human effort)

- `RFC 8555`_ + others (IETF *acme* working group)

.. _RFC 8555: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555


1.1: ACME clients and servers
=============================

- *Let's Encrypt*: a major public CA

  - *Boulder*: their CA software

- *Certbot*: popular general-purpose client
  - in Fedora, not in RHEL

- *mod_md*: Apache httpd client module
  - in Fedora and RHEL

- Many other client programs, libs and plugins


2. Demo
=======


3. Dogtag ACME service
======================

- Optional subsystem; Tomcat application in ``pki-tomcatd`` process

- Acts as *registration authority (RA)* to some issuer

- Supports different issuer systems e.g. Dogtag, NSSDB

- Supports different databases e.g. LDAP, PostgreSQL

- Supports ``dns`` identifer and ``http-01`` and ``dns-01``
  challenges

- File-based configuration


4. FreeIPA ACME service
=======================

- Deploy Dogtag ACME service with Dogtag issuer

- Store objects in Dogtag LDAP (``ou=acme,o=ipaca``)

- ACME accounts are unrelated to FreeIPA accounts

- Deploy automatically on **all CA servers** (initially disabled)

- Point clients at ``https://ipa-ca.$DOMAIN/acme/directory``

- Upstream design doc: https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/ACME


4.1: Supported clients
======================

- ACME service is client-agnostic

- It *should* work if client...

  1. asks for supported identifier type (``dns``)

  2. can respond to an offered challenge types (``http-01``,
     ``dns-01``)

- Impossible to test all clients

  - Can strengthen support statement for those we do test

- Clients could have bugs/quirks (probably server too).  As we roll
  out, we will find out.


4.2: Pull request
=================

- https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa/pull/4723

- This is what was planned for RHEL 8.3, but didn't make it

- It is ready for review

- ``master`` only
  - backport to ``ipa-4-8`` is feasible if required



5. Testing
==========

- integration tests in ``test_integration/test_acme.py``

  - added to gating, for now

- enable/disable checks (via *curl*)

- *Certbot*: http-01, dns-01 and revocation
  - Fedora only; no Certbot on RHEL

- *mod_md*: http-01
  - Fedora + RHEL; dns-01 is possible


5.1: Test enablement
========================

- ``/usr/libexec/ipa/acme/certbot-dns-ipa``
  - hook script for Certbot ``dns-01`` challenge
  - in ``freeipa-client`` package
  - might be useful for users/customers

- similar program could be written for *mod_md* dns-01



6.1. Limitations (features)
===========================

- Only ``dns`` identifier

- Only ``http-01`` and ``dns-01`` challenges

- Cannot configure challenge types to use

- Issuer is ``ipa`` CA (cannot use sub-CA)

- No account key rollover

- *All of these* require work on Dogtag side


6.2. Limitations (administration)
=================================

- Configuration is file-based and per-server

- Cannot specify a different profile (but you can modify that
  profile)

- Cannot direct requests to different profiles

  - This would be required if we ever support different identifier
    types


7: The next epic
==================

FreeIPA-4669: *Manage the ACME service topology-wide from single
system.*

- Consistent with rest of FreeIPA admin experience

- Easier for admin: config change gets replicated

- Prevent inconsistent configuration (which is dangerous)


7.1: FreeIPA parts
==================

- IPA API commands to manage ACME, e.g. (not prescriptive):

  - ``ipa acme-config-mod --enabled=1``
  - ``ipa acme-config-show``

- Associated permissions

- Deprecate or remove ``ipa-acme-manage`` command, or wrap new
  commands.


7.2: Dogtag parts
=================

- LDAP *config source*: monitor or poll ACME config entry

- If config object is in FreeIPA subtree, may need GSS-API authn

  - ``dogtag/$SERVER_FQDN@$REALM`` principal already exists

  - State of GSS-API bind support in *ldapjdk* is unknown

- Otherwise maybe find a way to bind as
  ``uid=pkidbuser,ou=people,o=ipaca``, or write the config object
  under ``o=ipaca``.

7.3: Suggested approach
=======================

1. Assign FreeIPA developer + Dogtag developer

2. Preliminary investigation of ldapjdk GSS-API support,
   cross-database authentication

3. Agree on LDAP config object schema

4. Most work can be done in parallel


8.1. Future work: SHOULD
========================

- Configure (sub-)CA to use for ACME

- Configure challenges

- Expired object pruning (RHCS-798)

- ``tls-alpn-01`` challenge

- Performance testing (RHCS-1259)


8.2. Future work: MAYBE
=======================

- ``ip`` identifier

- Configure profile

- Block/allow lists (RHCS-1276)


8.3. Future work: MAYBE NOT
===========================

- Allow wildcard certificates

  - Customers will probably ask, we should push back; automation
    subsumes wildcard certs

8.4. Future work: SPECULATION
=============================

- `End-user`_ and `S/MIME`_ certs?

.. _End-user: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-client/
.. _S/MIME: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-email-smime/

- Integration with IDM accounts?

  - "Enterprise ACME" is totally undefined; let's listen to
    customers and keep an open mind
