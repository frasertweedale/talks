Parser combinators: live coding a JSON parser from scratch
==========================================================

Parser combinators are like LEGO. You start with small, simple
parsers and assemble them into more complex parsers.  This promotes
code reuse and aids testing and maintenance. I will demonstrate this
powerful technique by live-coding a parsing library and JSON parser
from scratch!

I'll use Haskell, a popular functional programming language. But
language is no barrier; I'll also review some library options for
other mainstream languages.

Recording of a similar presentation I gave at a user group:

This presentation will be more focused, driving toward the JSON
parser objective.  I will also review popular combinator parser
library options for the dominant languages at ConFoo (Go, Java, JS,
PHP, Python, Ruby, etc).
