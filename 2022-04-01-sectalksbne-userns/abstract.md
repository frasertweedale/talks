# User namespaces 

Linux container escapes continue to affect Kubernetes and derived
products.  User namespaces are one of the techniques that can
mitigate the risk.  In this presentation I will explain the past,
present and future of user namespace support in Kubernetes.  There
will be demos!

Attendees should expect to learn more about what containers are, the
technologies that underpin Linux containers, and how Kuberetes
actually runs containers.
