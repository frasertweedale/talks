The Best Test Data is Random Test Data
======================================

Abstract
--------

Testing accounts for a large portion of the cost of software
development.  Tools to automate testing allow for more thorough
testing in less time.  *Property-based testing* provides ways to
define expected properties of functions under test, and mechanisms
to automatically check whether those properties hold in a large
number of cases - or whether a property can be falsified.

This talk will establish the motivations and explore the mechanisms
of property-based testing.  Concepts will be demonstrated primarily
using Haskell's *QuickCheck* library.  We will also review
property-based testing solutions for other popular languages.

The talk will conclude with a discussion of the limitations of
property-based testing, and alternative approaches.

The discussion of limitations of property-based testing will include
a tantalising glimpse at theorem proving systems.
