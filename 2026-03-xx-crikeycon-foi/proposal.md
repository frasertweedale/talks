# Can the government stand on security by obscurity?

Governments nowadays provide many kinds of digital services, and a
menagerie of mobile apps for accessing them.  With few exceptions,
these applications are closed source.  Transparency into what they
do, and whether they do it securely, is limited.  When asked to
open the kimono, agencies typically double down on secrecy, eroding
trust.  Security and trust require transparency - and that means
source code.

This is the story of *Tweedale and CEO, Services Australia*, a
Freedom of Information matter currently before the Administrative
Review Tribunal.  In 2021 I requested the source code for the *myGov
Code Generator* app, a basic 2FA app for myGov login.  The agency
refused on grounds that mostly boil down to "security by obscurity".
Five years after my initial request, the Tribunal will decide
whether their arguments stand up to scrutiny.

In this talk I'll explain how the (federal) Freedom of Information
system works, the history of this matter, and the main arguments and
evidence in play.  I will critique Services Australia's arguments
within the broader context of government technology and
cybersecurity policy.  We will also compare and contrast the current
matter with previous attempts to get source code via FOI.  I will
conclude by contemplating the consequences of success or failure in
my proceeding.
