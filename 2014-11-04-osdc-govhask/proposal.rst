Talk Title
==========

GovHask - Haskell, open data and rapid app development.


Abstract
========

Learn what happened when three functional programming aficionadi took
on the GovHack open data competition armed with little more than a
Haskell compiler, some Hackage packages and whole lot of hubris.

GovHack is an annual open data event in Australia.  A coordinated
release of federal, state and local government data is celebrated
with a weekend-long hackfest, with prizes awarded for the most
interesting and useful apps, mashups or remixes.

Three hackers (including the presenter) who are passionate about
Haskell - a strongly typed, purely functional programming language -
decided to put their skills to the test and entered GovHack 2014 to
see what they could build in a weekend using Haskell.

This presentation will:

- Introduce the team and explain why we are passionate about
  Haskell, types and functional programming.

- Demonstrate the thing we built during GovHack.

- Provide some high-level implementation details of the submission
  (no prior Haskell or functional programming knowledge required).

- Discuss how we benefited from using Haskell in this competition,
  as well as the pain points.

- Encourage people to try Haskell, and exhort them to support open
  data initiatives.

This presentation will not:

- Attempt to explain monads.


Private abstract
================

The abstract was written *prior to* GovHack 2014 - this is why
details about the project are conspicuously absent.  If possible, I
may amend the abstract later to include some information about
whatever we do end up building.


Target audience
===============

Developers


Speaker Bio
===========

Fraser is a developer at Red Hat, where he works on the FreeIPA
identity management solution and Dogtag Certificate System.  He is
passionate about security and privacy.  In his spare time, Fraser
writes a lot of Haskell and patiently awaits the strongly-typed
functional programming revolution.
