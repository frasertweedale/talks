Controlling the Dumpster Fire: The CA Industry in 2016 and Beyond


Abstract
--------

2016 was a significant year for the dumpster fire that is the CA
industry.  In one sense, nothing much changed: CAs continued to
charge big money for random-looking bit strings whilst occasionally
doing Bad Things or having their infrastructure hijacked.  But
things are changing!

In this talk I will recap the events of 2016 and discuss a variety
of ongoing efforts to control the fire, including:

- The WoSign / StartCom backdated certificate shenanigans, and
  browser vendors waking up and finding that they are strong

- The impact of Let's Encrypt (a free, automated, publicly trusted
  CA) including (hilarious) reactions of incumbent CAs

- Certificate misissuance (Symantec et al.) and how Certificate
  Transparency logs can be used to detect misissuance

- Altogether avoiding the CA cartel with DNSSEC-based certificate
  trust (DANE)
