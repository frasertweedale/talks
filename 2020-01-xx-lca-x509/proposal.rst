X.509: Beyond TLS
=================

Target audience: Developer


Abstract
--------

Most developers and sysadmins know about X.509 as the certificate
format used in TLS.  The push to encrypt the web means that web
developers and administrators are using digital certificates more
than ever.  But certificates have other applications you might not
have known about.  Come to this talk to learn how public key
cryptography with X.509 public key infrastructure is used to encrypt
mails, secure workstation logins and even validate your passport at
the airport!

We will begin with a review of public key cryptography fundamentals.
Then we will examine the anatomy of X.509 certificates and chains of
trust, and discuss how certificates are used in TLS.

Moving beyond TLS, we will explore use cases including S/MIME for
email security, Smart Card-based system login, Kerberos PKINIT,
passport verification and document signing.

The talk will conclude with a discussion of recent developments in
certificate security, including ACME and Certificate Transparency.
