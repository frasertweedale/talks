Certificates: Beyond SSL
========================

30 minute primer.


Abstract
--------

You know about X.509 as the certificate format used in SSL/TLS. But 
certificates have many other uses. Learn how public key cryptography
and X.509 PKI is used to encrypt email, secure workstation logins,
validate passports and more!

This talk will recap PKI and TLS basics. Then we will explore
several other certificate use cases (with some demos).  Attendees'
minds will be opened to the versitility of X.509 (or PKI in general).


Private abstract
----------------

I live and breathe X.509 certificates in my day job, and have seen
many interesting use cases that I hope will interest the audience
and get them thinking outside the box when it comes to PKI.

Depending on time available, the demos in order of priority will be:

1. System login
2. S/MIME
3. Kerberos PKINIT
