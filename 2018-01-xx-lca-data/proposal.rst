What is data?
=============

Day in, day out, programmers write programs to create, compute,
compare, correlate and compile data, big and small.  Data is
fundamental to what we do, but have you ever pondered the
fundamentals of data?

In this presentation we will explore some philosophies of
information and mathematics, examining their links to programming
and addressing questions including:

- Are primitive data types *really* primitive?  Are they necessary
  in programming?  If not, what is is like to program with them?

- Are functions data?  Are data functions, or can you represent a
  datum as a function, and are there benefits to doing so?

- Does data have meaning on its own, or does it only have meaning
  inside a program or the human mind?  Can a datum or a program have
  multiple interpretations?

- Can data be infinite?  If so, can infinite data be practical and
  useful in computing?

Practical concepts will be demonstrated in a variety of programming
languages, including Python and Haskell.


Private abstract
================

Some of the philosophies and fields we will examine at include
mathematical constructivism, finitism and ultrafinitism,
communication theory and type theory.

Some of the practical things we will be looking at include defining
data from the most primitive definitions possible, church encoding,
multiple interpretations of single programs, and working with
infinite (or too large to represent) data structures to solve real
problems (e.g. a tree of every possible chess game.)
