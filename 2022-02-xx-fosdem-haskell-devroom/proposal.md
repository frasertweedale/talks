# Haskell Devroom

## Description

Haskell is a statically typed functional programming language.  Its
vibrant community spans industry, academia and the hobbyist realm.
Haskell is seeing increasing adoption in industry, in a variety of
sectors.  It is a general purpose language, but is particuarly
popular in finance, high-assurance systems and implementing
compilers.

The Haskell devroom welcomes people new to Haskell or functional
programming, as well as intermediate or experienced Haskell
programmers.  We will seek talks/sessions on topics such as:

- Introductory talks teaching functional programming concepts and
  Haskell programming

- Exposition of free software projects written in Haskell, with tips
  for new contributors

- Practical advice for Haskell programming: developer tools, package
  ecosystem, Haskell in production.

- "Show and tell" session for people to show Haskell projects they
  are involved with.

- Experience reports: problems you attacked using Haskell, and what
  were the outcomes?

- What is going on in the Haskell community?  Where and how you can
  get involved.


## Why does it fit FOSDEM?

Notable free software projects written in Haskell include Pandoc
(text processing), Xmonad (window manager), TidalCycles (music
composition), ShellCheck (shell script linter) and GitHub *semantic*
(source code analysis).

The Haskell devroom will:

- Advocate the Haskell programming language to a wide audience of
  developers.

- Promote and encourage participation in free software projects
  written in Haskell (or starting of new ones).

- Teach Haskell programming techniques, and introduce important
  libraries, frameworks or developer tools.


## Submitter's affinity to the topic

I am one of the organisers of the Brisbane Functional Programming
Group, an FP user group in Brisbane, Australia.  I also maintain
several Haskell free software projects and libraries.
