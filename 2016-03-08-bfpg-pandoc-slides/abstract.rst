A slideshow toolchain with ReST, Pandoc and LaTeX Beamer
========================================================

Giving technical presentations is a worthwhile and satisfying
endeavour, but producing a quality slide deck can be a frustrating
and time consuming activity.  It needn't be.

In this talk I will show you my slide toolchain which, in brief,
turns ReStructuredText (a lightweight markup format) into a PDF via
Pandoc (a "universal document converter" written in Haskell),
allowing me to focus on the structure and content of my
presentations and not worry about formatting.

We will cover basic formatting, math, code, images, Unicode, foreign
scripts, slide appearance and themes, and how to escape from ReST
and access the full power of LaTeX when needed.  There will also be
a brief detour into Pandoc internals and a discussion of ways to
vary the toolchain for alternative markup language preferences or
output formats.
